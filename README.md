# Client Relationship Management Database Design

## Executive Summary
The Client Relationship Management (CRM) database is designed to efficiently track interactions with clients, manage communications, and update case information. By utilizing MongoDB, a flexible document-oriented database, this system allows for seamless storage and retrieval of client-related data.

## Project Requirement
